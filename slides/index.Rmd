# Answers: Transparency + a model?

  geom_smooth(method = "lm")

gg_height_lm
```

???

- This helps reduce the overplotting
- It's not that this is wrong, it is useful - but we lose the individuals
- We only get the overall average. We dont get the rest of the information
- How do we even get started?
---


# But we forget about the **individuals**

```{r heights-dec}
heights_dec <- heights %>%
  features(height_cm, feat_five_num) %>%
  filter(max == max(max)) %>%
  left_join(heights, by = "country")

gg_height_highlight <-

            size = 3) +

                   aes(label = country,
                       colour = nipa$orange),

                   size = 10) + 
  theme(legend.position = "none")

gg_height_highlight
```

???

- The model might make some good overall predictions
- But it can be really _ill suited_ for some individual
- Exploring this is somewhat clumsy - we need another way to explore

Let's see that **one more time**, but with the data
]

---

## Identify features: one observation per **key**

```{r print-heights-again}
heights[1:9, ]
```

---

## Identify features: one observation per **key**

```{r create-feature-five-1}
heights_five <- heights %>%
  features(height_cm, #<<
           feat_five_num) #<<
```

```{r print-heights-for-features}
heights_five
```

---

## Identify important features and decide how to filter 

```{r jus-obs, echo = TRUE}
heights_five %>% 
  filter(max == max(max) | max == min(max))
```

---

## Join summaries back to data

```r
heights_five %>% 
  filter(max == max(max) | max == min(max)) %>% 
  left_join(heights, by = "country")
```

```{r show-code}
heights_five %>% 
  filter(max == max(max) | max == min(max)) %>% 
  left_join(heights, by = "country") %>% 
  head()
```

---

```{r show-doggo, out.width = "60%"}
include_graphics("gifs/dog-solve-problem.gif")
```

---

## Identify features: one per **key** <img src="https://feasts.tidyverts.org/reference/figures/logo.png" align="right" height=140/>

```{r show-features, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
heights %>%
  features(height_cm, #<<
           feat_five_num) #<<
```
 
```{r create-feature-five}
heights_five <- heights %>%
  features(height_cm, #<<
           feat_five_num) #<<

print(heights_five, n = 6)
```

---

## What is the range of the data? `feat_ranges`

```r
heights %>%
  features(height_cm, feat_ranges)
```

```{r features-feat-ranges, echo = FALSE}
heights %>%
  features(height_cm, feat_ranges) %>% 
  head()
```

---

## Does it only increase or decrease? `feat_monotonic`

```r
heights %>%
  features(height_cm, feat_monotonic)
```

```{r features-feat-monotonic}
heights %>%
  features(height_cm, feat_monotonic) %>% 
  head()
```

---

## What is the spread of my data? `feat_spread`

```r
heights %>%
  features(height_cm, feat_spread) 
```

```{r features-feat-spread}
heights %>%
  features(height_cm, feat_spread) %>% 
  head()
```

# Take homes

## Problem #1: How do I look at **some** of the data?


.large[
1. Longitudinal data is a time series
2. Specify structure once, get a free lunch.
3. Look at as much of the raw data as possible 
4. Use `facet_sample()` / `facet_strata()`
]

---

# Take homes

## Problem #2: How do I find **interesting** observations?

.large[
1. Decide what features are interesting
2. Summarise down to one observation
3. Decide how to filter
4. Join this feature back to the data

# Future Directions

.large[
`r icon::fa_mortar_pestle()` More features (summaries)

`r icon::fa_binoculars()` Generalise beyond time series

`r icon::fa_compass()` Explore stratification process

`r icon::fa_code()` Work with `dplyr::across()` & `dplyr::pick()`
